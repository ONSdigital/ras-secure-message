# A ServiceMockToggle is intended to support switching between a Mock and a Real Service without the
# client code being impacted . Typical use is to define a class which knows about the mock and real service
# Default to use the real service , and call use_mock_service in test scenarios
# Client code is still free to call the mock directly , but this should be in tests only
